== CICD Strategy
 
The deployment strategy can be segmented into two parts:

* Infrastructure Deployment
* App Deployment

Container App Environment deployment via Infrastructure pipeline, Container App deployment via Application pipeline.

This approach separates the deployment of the Container App Environment and the Container App itself:

* Infrastructure Deployment Pipeline:
** Deploys Container App Environment and other required resources.
** Does not provision the Container App at this stage.

* Application Deployment Pipeline:
** Builds application code and publishes the image to the container registry.
** Provisions the Container App using Terraform with the newly created image.
