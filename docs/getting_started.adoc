== Getting Started

One of the things with the Ensono Digital Independent Runner (EDIR) is that it is designed to make things easier for people to run things locally that will also be run by the CI/CD platform. That is all well and good, but not if it has not been used before. This section provides a quick overview of how to start off with the repo from scratch.

=== Prerequisites

Please ensure that the following prerequisites are satisfied:

* Docker Engine
** This can be Docker, Rancher Desktop or Podman
* Taskctl (https://github.com/russellseymour/taskctl/releases)

NOTE: Taskctl has been forked to add some new functionality to the tool that this repository uses.

=== Setup

In order to run the pipeline locally a number of environment variables are required. These are used to pass variable values to Terraform. The following table shows what these variables are. If you require more help running this module locally please look at the Terraform Repository and its associated README.md here ~> https://github.com/Ensono/terraform-azurerm-aca/blob/main/README.md

==== PowerShell

If using PowerShell there is a cmdlet in the Ensono Stacks Independent Runner module that reads the `build/config/stage_envvars.yml` and creates a skeleton PowerShell script which will setup the variables.

[source,powershell,linenums]
---
New-EnvConfig -Path .\build\config\stage_envvars.yml -scriptPath local -Cloud Azure -Stage stacks-aca
---

The resultant script will be `local/envvar-azure-stacks-aca.ps1`. The naming convention is `envvar-<CLOUD>-<STAGE>.ps1`.

.Environment variable script
image::images/envvar-script.png[width=500]

Edit this file as needed and then run the script `. ./local/envvar-azure-stacks-aci.ps1`. This will then setup the necessary environment variables in your local shell. These will then be copied into the container when it is spun up by Taskctl.

==== Bash

Currently we do not have an option when running in `bash` for creating such a script file. We have some ideas on how this will be done, but the biggest issue is how this will be distributed.

=== Running the Pipelines

Now that the environment has been configured the pipelines can be run.

[cols="1,4",options=header,stripes=even]
|===
| # | Command
| 1 | `taskctl lint`
| 2 | `taskctl infrastructure`
| 3 | `taskctl tests`
| 4 | `taskctl docs`
|===

These pipelines can be run in any order based on the task that needs to be accomplished. In addition to these any of the tasks, as described in <<Pipeline>> can be executed.
